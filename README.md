# CLASSIFICATION-OF-DEPRESSION-ON-SOCIAL-MEDIA-USING-TEXT-MINING
The goal of our project is to exploit the massive data issued from social media and apply social media mining and sentiment analysis methods to detect at-risk people. By analyzing linguistic markers in social media posts, itâ€™s possible to create a deep learning model that can give an individual insight into his or her mental health far earlier than traditional approaches.


In this project EDA is applied on the dataset of twitter tweets and model is trained to predict the tweets whether it is good, bad or neutral.
